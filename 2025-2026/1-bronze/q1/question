1,Bessie the cow has in her possession A chips of type A and B chips of type B (0≤A,B≤109
  
  ). She can perform the following operation as many times as she likes:
  
      If you have at least cB
  
  chips of type B, exchange cB chips of type B for cA chips of type A (1≤cA,cB≤109
  
      ).
  
  Determine the minimum non-negative integer x
  such that the following holds: after receiving x additional random chips, it is guaranteed that Bessie can end up with at least fA chips
  of type A (0≤fA≤109
  
  ).
  
  INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):
  The first line contains T
  , the number of independent test cases (1≤T≤104).
  
  Then follow T
  tests, each consisting of five integers A,B,cA,cB,fA
  
  .
  
  OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):
  Output the answer for each test on a separate line.
  
  Note: The large size of integers involved in this problem may require the use of 64-bit integer data types (e.g., a "long long" in C/C++).

  For the first test, Bessie initially starts with no chips. If she receives any 9
  additional chips, she can perform the operation to end up with at least 5 chips of type A. For example, if she receives 2 chips of type A
  and 7 chips of type B, she can perform the operation twice to end up with 6≥5 chips of type A. However, if she only receive 8 chips of
  type B, she can only end up with 4<5
  
  chips of type A.
  
  For the fourth test, she already has enough chips of type A from the start.
  
  SCORING:
  
      Input 3: cA=cB=1
  
  Inputs 4-5: x≤10
  for all cases
  Inputs 6-7: cA=2
  , cB=3
  
      Inputs 8-12: No additional constraints.
